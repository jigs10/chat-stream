## Environment Variables
Create a \`.env.local\` file in the project root and add the following:

\`\`\`
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
\`\`\`

You can get your API key from:  
[gemini ai studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

---

## How It Works
1. The frontend component (\`ChatView.tsx\`) takes user input and sends it to \`/api/chat\`.
2. The backend (\`route.ts\`) receives the request, sends it to Gemini API, and reads the response as a stream.
3. The chunks of text from Gemini are decoded and streamed back to the frontend.
4. The frontend continuously updates the assistant message as new data arrives.
5. The user sees the AI typing in real time, similar to ChatGPT.

## Setup and Run
\`\`\`bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
\`\`\`

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
